  variables (ex. ..\proj\meta\composer)
- Move all of the code files into xampp\htdocs

    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306

  - Change the URL to http://IP:808xPort, for example, http://10.92.4.216:8080
  - Change the VITE DEV SERVER URL to http://IP:517xPort (using 'netstat -aon | findstr 517x' CMD where you chose the most recent available port),

- Go to phpMyAdmin in XAMPP control panel by hitting the admin button next to MySQL, go to the import tab, and import the import text file in this directory
- run a terminal in the directory of the code, run npm run build (if the styling still doesn't work after than, run npm run dev instead)

- ADMIN LOGIN: dcadmin, dcadmin8162
- To get this system functional, have all users run (or have datto run) 'dock_scripts\p_root-script.ps1'. This will install the powershell scripts that send dock and status
  information to the server

  - This will also need to run on all new computers computers that users use if we want to keep track of their laptop
