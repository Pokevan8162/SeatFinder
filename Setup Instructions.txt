    of it and the port after the colon. For example, 10.x.x.xxx:8080
  - Find the line 'DocumentRoot "../xampp/htdocs" and edit it to add another directory for the code

    - Uncomment and configure this line with your password: '# password       = your_password'
  - Save and exit
- Go to the XAMPP install directory, find the htdocs folder, create a file called 'seatfinder' and dump the code into that file
- Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
- If not already installed, download and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download download the windows msi installer, check
  the checkbox for automatically install the necesarry tools) version 24.5.0

- If not already installed, download and install composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/ hit download composer link, in the
  installer choose download globally, it should automatically choose the php version that you just set to path, also you don't need a proxy) version 2.8.9 and set to system path
  variables (ex. ..\proj\meta\composer)
  - After install, run these four lines in cmd:
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'.PHP_EOL; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'.PHP_EOL; unlink('composer-setup.php'); exit(1); }"
    php composer-setup.php
- Open XAMPP Control Panel in admin (will be the xampp-control file in the xampp install folder), hit the config button in the very top right

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3307
    DB_DATABASE=xxxxxxx
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
  - Change the port to the 330x port
  - Change the database name to the actual database in phpMyAdmin
  - Change the username and password to your configured username and password (default is shown)
  - Find this section in the .env file:
    APP_URL=http://10.x.x.xxx:8080
    VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://10.x.x.xxx:5174 (unsure if this is actually needed)
  - Change the URL to http://IP:808xPort, for example, http://10.x.x.xxx:8080
  - Change the VITE DEV SERVER URL to http://IP:517xPort (using 'netstat -aon | findstr 517x' CMD where you chose the most recent available port),
    for example, http://10.x.x.xxx:5173 (unsure if this is actually needed)
- Run a terminal in the directory of the code (htdocs/seatfinder), run npm install
  - run npm audit fix if it asks
  - run composer install (type y if it asks to keep original composer.json)
  - run npm run build
  - run cd .., then run php artisan storage:link for image storage and presentation on the web (link might already be established)
- navigate to xamppInstallLocation\htdocs\seatfinder\config\database.php, change the 'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'sqlite'), line to 'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'mysql')
- ensure that editorconfig, env, env.example, gitattributes, and gitignore all have a period at the beginning of their file name
- restart xampp apache and mysql
- in the browser, open ipAddress:port (ex. 10.x.x.xxx:808xport) and you should be taken to the home page
- for editing the code: if not already installed, install laravel version 12.14.1. This project used tailwind version 4.1.6
- run php artisan migrate:fresh for db population and starting the server status checker (this also servers as a reset point if needed, reference database/migrations/create_docks_and_employees.php
  file for the migration itself)
- open task scheduler, find the task named dock_observe_user_activity, right click, properties, triggers, edit the trigger, and change it from 1 day to indefinitely in the
  'for a duration of' section. sorry to make this manual, i just could not for the life of me figure out how to automate this and i dont know if you can
- ADMIN LOGIN: dcadmin, dcadmin8162
- To get this system functional, have all users run (or have datto run) 'H:\Administration\IT\dock_scripts\p_root-script.ps1'. This will install the powershell scripts that send dock and status
  information to the server
  - This will also need to run on all new computers computers that users use if we want to keep track of their laptop
